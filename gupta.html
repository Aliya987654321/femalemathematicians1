        <h3>    Neena Gupta (born 24 November 1984[1]) is a professor at the Statistics and Mathematics Unit of the
            Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata.[2] Her primary fields of interest are commutative algebra
            and affine algebraic geometry.

            Education
            Gupta graduated with honours in mathematics from Bethune College in 2006. She earned her post graduation in
            mathematics from the Indian Statistical Institute in 2008[9] and subsequently, her Ph.D. degree in 2011 with
            commutative algebra as her specialization under the guidance of Amartya Kumar Dutta. The title of her dissertation
            was "Some results on Laurent polynomial fibrations and Quasi A*-algebras".

            he 2024 Infosys Science Foundation Prize in Mathematical Sciences category is the latest in a series of accolade
            that Neena Gupta of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), Kolkata has received for her significant work in mathematics.
           Introducing the awardee and her work, the following prize citation1 was read out by the Jury Chair Chandrashekhar Khare:

            Prof. Neena Guptaâ€™s work has had a big impact in the field of algebraic geometry, particularly through her solution to
            the long-standing Zariski Cancellation Problem. Her work answers a very basic question which can be informally described
            as: if two geometric objects have the same structure after adding a dimension to them, can one deduce that they are in
            fact the same? In her breakthrough work she showed that, in positive characteristic, contrary to what one might expect,
            the answer is in the negative. Thus, the innocuous looking move of adding a dimension can destroy information.</h3>
