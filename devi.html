    <h3>       Shakuntala Devi (4 November 1929 â€“ 21 April 2013) was an Indian calculator,<br>
         astrologer, and writer, popularly known as the "Human Computer". Her talent earned <br>
         her a place in the 1982 edition of The Guinness Book of World Records. However, <br>
         the certificate for the record was given posthumously on 30 July 2020, despite Devi<br>
         achieving her world record on 18 June 1980 at Imperial College, London. Devi was a <br>
         precocious child, and she demonstrated her arithmetic abilities at the University of<br>
         Mysore without any formal education.

         

        Devi strove to simplify numerical calculations for students.[1] She wrote several books<br>
        in her later years, including novels as well as texts about mathematics, puzzles, and <br>
        astrology. She wrote the book The World of Homosexuals, which is considered the first <br>
        study of homosexuality in India.[2][3] She saw homosexuality in a positive light and<br>
        is considered a pioneer in the field.[2]</h3>
